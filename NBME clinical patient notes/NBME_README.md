The text data presented in this data is from the USMLEÂ® Step 2 Clinical Skills examination, a medical licensure exam. This exam measures a trainee's ability to recognize
pertinent clinical facts during encounters with standardized patients.During this exam, each test taker sees a Standardized Patient, a person trained to portray a clinical case. 
After interacting with the patient, the test taker documents the relevant facts of the encounter in a patient note. Each patient note is scored by a trained physician who looks for the presence of certain key concepts or features relevant to the case as described in a rubric. 
The goal of this competition is to develop an automated way of identifying the relevant features within each patient note, with a special focus on the patient history portions of the notes where the information from the interview with the standardized patient is documented.
